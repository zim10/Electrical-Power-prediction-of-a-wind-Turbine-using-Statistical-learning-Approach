Data collection

I have taken dataset from ‘engie’ website and Whole Dataset  contains data for four wind turbines named (R80711, R80721, R80736, R80790) and  turbine Manufacture is Senvion. There are 218588 (above two lakh observations)  and 49 features in the actual dataset and I mostly selected those features that affect electricity power production of a wind turbine.
