Data collection

My PhD supervisor ( Dr. Jianwu Wang) suggests this ‘engie’ website for collecting and working on one of the Datasets. Whole Dataset  contains data for four wind turbines named (R80711, R80721, R80736, R80790) and  turbine Manufacture is Senvion. There are 218588 (above two lakh observations)  and 49 features in the actual dataset and I’ve taken one turbine (R80711) and separated 12000 data with 13 features for this project.I mostly selected those features that affect electricity power production of a wind turbine.
