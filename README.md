# Electrical-Power-prediction-of-a-wind-Turbine-using-Statistical-learning-Approach
Most Electrical Power stations are Fossil fuel based that emit gigaton carbon dioxide in the air.For a Sustainable world,the use of fossil fuels to produce electricity needs to change. Renewable energy is the only alternative to fossil fuels but itâ€™s not reliable, affordable and desirable because of its unpredictable nature. If we are able to predict the nature of Renewable energy like wind energy using statistical learning algorithms, it can bring a revolution in the production of electricity. There are many factors involved in wind energy production like wind direction, speed, air temperature, and air density that need to be considered to have the highest electric power from a wind turbine. Statistical learning can help to fix those criteria to harness maximum power from a wind turbine. The main objective of this project is to use statistical learning algorithms to predict electrical power of a wind turbine.

**The follwoing Research Questions I have tried to solve:**

* Is there a relationship between the wind speed (predictor) and the power (response)?How strong is the relationship? 

* Is the relationship between the predictor (wind speed) and the response (power) positive or negative?

* What is the predicted power associated with a wind speed of 12? What are the associated 95% confidence and prediction intervals?

Is there a relationship between all predictors and the response?

Which predictors appear to have a statistically significant relationship to the response?
